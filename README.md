# ProjectEuler
A collection of solutions to <a href="www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems using python 3. <br>
I love working on good problems and do these for fun. Right now I'm just warming up but when I get to harder problems I'll start typing up my thought process and the math behind each problem. <br>
My goal is to do one problem a day starting from May 1st until at least August 31st.
